Higher-order functions (HOFs) in JavaScript are functions that can accept other functions as arguments, return functions, or both.

Benefits of Higher Order Functions:

1. Code Reusability
2. Modularity
3. Flexibility

JavaScript provides several built-in HOFs that are commonly used for array manipulation:
    Array.prototype.map()
    Array.prototype.filter()
    Array.prototype.reduce()
