Que: What is Promise Function?
Ans: A JavaScript Promise is an object representing the eventual outcome of an asynchronous operation. It acts as a placeholder for a value that is not available yet but will be resolved in the future, providing a structured way to handle async code without using deeply nested callbacks (callback hell).

Promise States
A promise can exist in one of three states: 
    1. pending (initial, ongoing operation), 
    2. fulfilled (successful completion with a value), 
    3. rejected (operation failed with a reason). 
A promise is considered settled if it is either fulfilled or rejected. 

Using Promises (.then(), .catch(), .finally()) 
Promises have instance methods to handle their outcomes: 
   - .then(onFulfilled, onRejected): Executes onFulfilled on success or onRejected on failure, returning a new promise for chaining.
   - .catch(onRejected): A shortcut for error handling, equivalent to .then(undefined, onRejected).
   - .finally(onFinally): Runs a handler regardless of the promise's outcome, often for cleanup.
