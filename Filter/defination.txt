JavaScript Interview Question:
Que: What is FILTER function?
Ans: The filter() method is an array function that creates a new array containing only the elements that pass a specific condition implemented by a provided function, without modifying the original array. It is non-mutating, meaning it leaves the original array unchanged.

How filter() Works
    - The filter() method iterates over each element in an array and calls a callback function for each one. The callback function should return a boolean value: 
        * If true is returned, the element is included in the new filtered array.
        * If false is returned, the element is excluded from the new filtered array.
