In JavaScript, functions are "first-class functions" or "first-class citizens". This means:
    Functions can be assigned to variables.
    Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions.
    Functions can be returned from other functions.
This is a foundation for callbacks, higher-order functions, and functional programming in JS.
