JavaScript Interview Question:
Que: How this keyword behaves differently?
Ans: The this keyword in JavaScript is a dynamic reference to the object that is executing the current function. Its value is determined at runtime by how a function is called, not where it is defined, making it a powerful and flexible concept.

1. In an Object Method (Implicit Binding)
When a function is called as a method of an object (using dot notation), this refers to the object itself. This allows the method to access the object's properties and other methods.

2. In an Arrow Function (Lexical Binding) 
Arrow functions behave differently; they do not have their own this binding. Instead, they inherit this from their immediately enclosing (parent) lexical scope (the scope where they were defined).

3. In a Regular Function (Default Binding)
When a regular, standalone function is called without being attached to an object, the value of this defaults to the global object (e.g., window in a browser, global in Node.js) in non-strict mode. 
In strict mode ('use strict'), this is undefined in a standalone function, which helps prevent accidental global variable creation. 

4. In a Constructor Function (New Binding) 
When a function is invoked with the new keyword, it acts as a constructor. JavaScript automatically creates a new, empty object and binds this to that new instance.

5. Explicit Binding (call, apply, and bind) 
You can explicitly force the value of this for a function call using the .call(), .apply(), or .bind() methods.
